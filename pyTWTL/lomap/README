----------------------------------------------------------------------

LTL Optimal Multi-Agent Planner (LOMAP) is a python package for
automatic planning of optimal paths for multi-agent systems.
See the directory 'examples' (either in the source archive or in
the installation directory) for examples.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

LOMAP uses two third party programs: LTL2BA and scheck. You can
find their sources in this distribution, in a directory called
'third_party_sources'. For your convenience, binaries of these
programs are already included in this distribution, in a folder
called 'binaries'. LOMAP also includes some code that is adapted
and/or taken from NetworkX Python package v1.6, available at
http://networkx.github.io. See below for copyright notices and 
licenses of LTL2BA, scheck, and NetworkX.

The LTL2BA software was written by Denis Oddoux and modified by Paul
Gastin.  It is based on the translation algorithm presented at CAV '01:
    P.Gastin and D.Oddoux

Part of the code included is issued from the SPIN software Version 3.4.1
The SPIN software is written by Gerard J. Holzmann, originally as part
of ``Design and Validation of Protocols,'' ISBN 0-13-539925-4,
1991, Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, 07632
Here are the files that contain some code from Spin v3.4.1 :   

    cache.c  (originally tl_cache.c)
    lex.c    (           tl_lex.c  )
    ltl2ba.h (       tl.h      )
    main.c   (       tl_main.c )
    mem.c    (       tl_mem.c  )
    parse.c  (       tl_parse.c)

scheck is a tool for translating safety LTL formulae to finite automata.
The algorithm used in the tool was presented in the paper:

Timo Latvala. Efficient Model Checking of Safety Properties. In:
  T. Ball and S.K. Rajamani (eds.), Model Checking Software. 10th
  International SPIN Workshop. Volume 2648 of LNCS, pp. 74-88, Springer, 2003.

This version of scheck incorporates some changes into scheck 1.2 that 
is available for download from Timo Latvala's website. The changes were
made so that scheck could be compiled on newer gcc compilers. The code
compiles fine with gcc 4.4.5. However, please note that I am not the
original developer or the current maintainer of this code. For further
details, please refer to README.html.

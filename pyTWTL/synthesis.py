''' Comments on implementation:
1) Finding the single source shortest paths in a DAG has O(V+E) complexity
(both positive and negative weights are allowed).
2) FUTURE: find best data structure with operations: union, intersection and
concatenation with update.
3) FUTURE: better way to represent paths and test for equality and compare.
4) FUTURE: Possible solution is to define a total order on the paths and
maintain the path sets as sorted lists.
5) DAG x G = DAG; Proof by contradiction. Only applicable to normal dfa, not
the infinity version.
